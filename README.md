# Tabula Portfolio Posts
This is a WordPress plugin, created for the Tabula series of themes.

It creates the custom post of "Portfolio" along with taxonomies "Work" and "Skills".

This plugin was originally pulled from the Tabula Premier theme (not released at this moment).

And in current development.
